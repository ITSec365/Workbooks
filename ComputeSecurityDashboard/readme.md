# Compute Security Dashboard for Microsoft Defender for Cloud

The new compute security dashboard for Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides you a unified view and full visibility to your virtual machine resources in Azure. If you have been actively using Azure virtual machines with  Microsoft Defender for Cloud in Azure, this workbook is for you!

Our newly dashboard is based on Azure Resource Graph (ARG) queries and divided to several sections such as:

-	**Virtual Machine Inventory:** summary view of all your virtual machine resources for selected subscription(s) with OS, size, powerstate, SKU details 
-	**Orphaned Assets:** Orphaned VM components like Disks, NICs, Availability Sets, Public IPs, NSGs (not attached to any VMs) 
-	**Virtual Machine Status:** VMs not having Managed Disks, VMs with pending reboot status, VMs shut down with their compliance status, List of extension in VMs, VMs with missing System Updates 
-	**Security Center recommendations:** filtered view of all Microsoft Defender for Cloud compute related recommendations including resource count, severity, and security control
-	**System Updates:** VMs missing system updates and filtered view of missing update details for selected VM
-	**System Baseline:** VMs missing security baseline configurations and filtered view of missing configuration details for selected VM
